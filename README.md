# NBA-Players-Stats-Scraping-Analysis-

I've grown as an NBA fan these past few years, and as a little challenge I decided to Scrape/Extract the Data from https://www.nba.com/
to do some Analysis.
# My goals were:
1. discover trends over the past 10 years
2. Comparing The Regular Season to The Playoffs
3. Minutes & Points Distribution
4. Find the most Productive Player in the past 10 years and 5 years.
5. Prove That Giannis is The Best Player in The NBA Statistically.

 # Steps to achieve results:
1. Scraping The Data from The web, https://www.nba.com/
2. Clean and Construct The Data for Analysis.
4. Added calculations to measure new Matrics:
(Pace - Production - Stats per 48 Minutes - Stats per 100 Possessions - True Shooting %)
5. Visualization 

   
Here are The findings:
